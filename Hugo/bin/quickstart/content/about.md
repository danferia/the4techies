The4Techies is a group of IT directors accross the Technology world, with experience managing networks and day to day devices. Our background in brand strategy, visual design, and have a strong competitive approach. We are fueled by passion for understanding the nuances of cross-cultural advertising. We consider ourselves a ‘forever tech,’ eager to build on academic foundations in information technology and stay in tune with the latest technology strategies through continued coursework.

Our hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action has contributed to our most recent success at CSUN, where we led international, award-winning campaigns for heavy-hitting brands, such as The4Techs, and Web Designing (4Lifers). Meanwhile, we vastly improved the productivity of our team by implementing strategic project management methods and ensuring a work-life balance for our group.

We believe mindfulness in the workplace is key to success - we live out through interests in technology, gaming, and social media. We are currently working on this crazy website and are always interested in a challenge. Reach out to the4techs@gmail.com to connect!
