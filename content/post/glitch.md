<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Glitch and Github Tips</h1>

Here are few basic tips on using Glitch with Github. Glitch is a great platform for web develpoment and web hosting. 

### Basics

Step 1. [Create a new repo in GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/). This can be a basic user repo or an organizational repo. If it is an organization, be sure to substitute the organization name. Learn about the [Differences between user and organization accounts](https://help.github.com/articles/differences-between-user-and-organization-accounts/).

Step 2. Go to your project in Glitch. Click on the 'Tools' button at the bottom of the left-hand menu.

Step 3. Before you can export your project to Glitch, you will need to grant Glitch access to your GitHub account. Click on 'Grant Access' to do this and approve the access request. You can always revoke access later through your GitHub account.

Step 4. Open the Tools menu again and click on the 'Export to GitHub' option. 
_Note: if the export option is grayed out, you will need to grant Glitch permission to your GitHub account_

Step 5. A pop-up window will ask you for your user/repo names. The user name will be either your GitHub account name or your organization name. The repo name is the one you just created in step 1. 

Step 6. A new popup will ask you for a commit comment. You can change the default or just leave as is!
