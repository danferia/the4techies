How to Setup Domain - the4techs.com 

Namecheap is one of the most popular domain registrars used by people all around the world. Registering a domain name with Namecheap is a quick and easy process.

Not very techie? Or haven’t bought a domain name before? No worries!

#1. Check to make sure your domain name is available

- First we’re going to see if our preferred domain name is available. Here’s what you first see when you go to Namecheap.com.
- Next, type in the domain name you want to check.

- I’ve typed in “the4techs” in the space above. They automatically fill in the “www” at the beginning and the “.com” at the end.
  If you don’t want a .com — maybe your site is for a nonprofit so you want .org — you can enter the extension you want, or click the box to select from a list of available top-     level domains.
