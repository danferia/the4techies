- I’ve typed in “the4techs” in the space above. They automatically fill in the “www” at the beginning and the “.com” at the end.
 
 
 #2. Add to Shopping Cart
 
 - Click the “Add to Cart” button 
 - Click View Cart to see more details.
 - Click the dropdown to select a time period, from 1 year to 10. Toggle the auto-renew button if you want to renew your domain name automatically at the end of that time.
 - Namecheap automatically gives you a year of WITHHELDforPRIVACY free when you register a domain name with them. This can cut down on the amount of spam email you’re likely to get.

#4 Complete your Registrant Information

<h1> Namecheap now shows your username <\h1> 

- Now follow the prompts to complete your registrant information. The Registrant Contact information is important!

They can all be the same, or each one can be different.


The Administrative Contact is the person you want to handle the day-to-day stuff like renewing the registration.

The Technical Contact could be the business owner, or the head of the IT or Marketing department.

And the Billing Contact, obviously, is the person who handles accounts receivable.

When you’re finished with all the registrant information, click the “Save and Continue” button, then go ahead and check out.
